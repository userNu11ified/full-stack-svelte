# Svelte + TS + Vite + Express

> Customized `npm init vite` with **Svelte + TS** including an **Express** backend.

---

### Pros

-   Speed and convenience of **Vite**.
-   Everything running under **one address**.
    -   Just **one port** to forward!
-   **Easier deploy**, requires running **one command**.

### Cons

-   Coupled frontend and backend.
-   Somebody developing just the frontend also clones the backend.

### Workspace setup

-   Frontend files can be found under `client`.
-   Backend files can be found under `server`.
-   `.gitignore` ignores `dist` of **both!**
